<div  class="eightys-paragraph">
 Now the number is much higher, and it's not just your name.

Your browser, your phone, and your apps are tracking you.
Cameras, microphones, and TVs are tracking you.
Your bank, stores you shop at and places you visit are tracking you.
Your ISP, your headphones, your vehicles, and sex toys are tracking you?
 
Is there anyone or anything that isn't tracking you?
 
This talk gives a detailed overview of the various AdTech and consumer profiling systems, explains in layman's terms how they operate
in concert to create a detailed picture of your life, and discusses how you could try to protect yourself from each (and if you would even want to). 
We'll also speculate about the dystopian future of these technologies.
 
This talk is NOT a discussion of government surveillance systems, but we may discuss how a malicious government might leverage this data.
